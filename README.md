# The Repo

Welcome to the Repo - code examples and documentation to be read in conjunction with the [Satya Nadella Sydney Developer Event 2016](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Microsoft-Australia/Developer-Event-2016/Keynote). After watching Satya, you can skip to ~53 minutes for the developer portion of the event. 

Head over to the [Wiki](https://github.com/MSFTAuDX/FutureDev2016/wiki) for all the info!

Cheers,
