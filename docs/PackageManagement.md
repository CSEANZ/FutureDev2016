# Package Management
## Build, manage, secure, and share your team's software components

Package Management is an extension that makes it easy to discover, install, and publish packages. It's deeply integrated with other Team Services hubs like Build so that package management can become a seamless part of your existing workflows.

Package Management is available in both Visual Studio Team Services ([extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.feed)) and Team Foundation Server 2017. It allows you to quickly and easily search all of your C#, VB, C++ and Java code and then dynamically refine the results.
