# Making Cloudy Code

*Separating concerns to create extensible code with Azure Service Bus and Logic Apps*

There is more to making your code "cloud awesome" than just sticking it on a new managed host like the Azure App Service and calling it a day. 

There are many tenets - one of them is separation of concerns. It's an oldy, but a goody. It's been around forever and it's super imporant. Used properly in the cloud, it not only means more maintainable code but more extensible code too. 

The basic idea is that each code module should do only one job, and each module should know as little as possible about other modules and how they work.
